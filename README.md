# Chromium-Licences

This repository is used to maintain the list of licences, associated with those Chromium components, that are used in TeamDev integration libraries:

- [JxBrowser](https://www.teamdev.com/jxbrowser)
- [DotNetBrowser](https://www.teamdev.com/dotnetbrowser)

The purpose of this storage is to provide licences texts to help conduct a legal review of the licences included in TeamDev libraries. 

While TeamDev libraries are proprietary and are provided under custom commercial licences, all the open source components are used under their associated open source licences and no use restrictions are applied to these open source components.

The releases in this repository are versioned by the numbers of Chromium versions, used in TeamDev libraries.

If you have any questions, related to this process, please contact us at info@teamdev.com.
